# Complex Numworks
A (terrible) complex function plotter for the numworks calculator.

Poorly written.  
(Trying to be) Fast (And failing to...)  
Working (Kind of...)

## How to install
Use the [Numwroks online uploader](https://my.numworks.com/apps) with the complex-numworks.nwa in the build directory.

## How to use
By default, values from -10-10i to 10+10i are plotted  
You can move arround using arrow keys, zoom in and out using +/- keys.  
And Home key to exit.  

Press Alpha and
 - E to make the axes equal
 - G to go to a specific value
 - S to use sigmoid style
 - R to use log2 style
 - T to use checkerboard style

Use the VAR key to enter value mode where a white dot moveable using the arrow keys display the values of `z` and `f(z)`.
Return to default mode by using the BACK key.

Use the TOOLBOX key to change the function:  
**IT'S A [RPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) NOTATION**

To enter a **real** number, press any digit and type your number then press EXE. Use - to switch number sign.  
For a complex one, just enter a real, use the I key and then just add another real as usual.  

The conjugate a number, use ALPHA + MINUS. And to get z conjugate, just use ALPHA + XNT.  
Use ALPHA+4 and ALPHA+TAN to add `Re(z)` and `Im(z)`

Parenthesis aren't implemented as there's no need for it in RPN.\
The Log key mean log base a:
`z 2 log = log2(z)`

## Why using it?
Despair.
