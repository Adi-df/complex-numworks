# Complex Numworks
A (terrible) complex function plotter for the numworks calculator.

Poorly written.  
(Trying to be) Fast (And failing to...)  
Working (Kind of...)

## How to install
Use the [Numwroks online uploader](https://my.numworks.com/apps) with the app.nwa in the build directory.

## How to use
By default, values from -10-10i to 10+10i are plotted  
You can move arround using arrow keys, zoom in and out using +/- keys.  
And Home key to exit.  

Press Alpha and
 - E to make the axes equal
 - S to activate/desactivate level lines

Use the VAR key to enter value mode where a white dot moveable using the arrow keys display the values of `z` and `f(z)`.
Return to default mode by using the BACK key.

Use the TOOLBOX key to change the function:  
**IT'S A [RPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) NOTATION**

To enter a **real** number, press any digit and type your number then press EXE.  
For a complex one, just enter a real, use the I key and then just add another real as usual.  

Parenthesis aren't implemented as there's no need for it in RPN.\
Square root, Tangent, log10 and inverse trig function are still not implemented.

## Why using it?
Despair.
